# Memory Optimization Guidelines

## Memory Usage Targets
- Maximum memory usage: 1GB
- Typical usage: 500-800MB
- Cache size: 256MB
- Model size: <100MB

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Data Processing
- Use streaming for large datasets
- Implement batch processing with small batches
- Clear intermediate variables promptly
- Use memory-efficient data types

### 2. Model Optimization
- Limit model complexity (max_depth=6)
- Use feature selection to reduce dimensionality
- Implement model pruning if needed
- Consider model quantization for inference

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Implement LRU eviction policy
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Clear cache periodically

### 4. Garbage Collection
- Force garbage collection after large operations
- Monitor memory growth patterns
- Set appropriate GC thresholds
- Use memory profiling tools

## Memory Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- Process memory usage (RSS)
- Virtual memory usage
- Memory growth rate
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- GC frequency and duration

### Alert Thresholds
- Memory usage > 85% of limit
- Memory growth > 100MB/hour
- Cache hit rate < 80%
- GC frequency > 10/minute

## Troubleshooting Memory Issues

### Common Causes
- Memory leaks in data processing
- Large objects not being released
- Inefficient caching strategies
- Model size too large

### Diagnostic Tools
- memory_profiler
- tracemalloc
- psutil for system monitoring
- Custom memory tracking

### Resolution Steps
1. Identify memory hotspots
2. Optimize data structures
3. Implement proper cleanup
4. Adjust cache sizes
5. Consider model optimization
