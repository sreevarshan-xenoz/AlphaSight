# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for developing a CPU-efficient machine learning pipeline for predicting the NIFTY 50 index. The system will integrate multi-source data including historical prices, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis from financial news to generate actionable trading signals. The pipeline is designed to operate under strict CPU-only computational constraints while maintaining sub-10ms inference latency and achieving high directional accuracy (target: 80%+) suitable for real-time trading applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Data Ingestion and Management

**User Story:** As a quantitative trader, I want the system to automatically collect and manage multi-source financial data, so that I have comprehensive, up-to-date information for making trading decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs daily data collection THEN it SHALL retrieve NIFTY 50 historical price data (OHLCV) from NSEpy API
2. WHEN collecting price data THEN the system SHALL maintain a rolling one-year window from current date minus 365 days
3. WHEN the system accesses news data THEN it SHALL collect financial news headlines from Economic Times API
4. WHEN processing news articles THEN the system SHALL filter articles within a 30-day relevance window
5. WHEN data collection fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue with available data sources
6. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL maintain chronological integrity to prevent look-ahead bias

### Requirement 2: Technical Indicator Computation

**User Story:** As a technical analyst, I want the system to compute essential technical indicators efficiently, so that I can incorporate proven market signals into my predictions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing historical price data THEN the system SHALL compute RSI(14) with O(n) time complexity
2. WHEN calculating moving averages THEN the system SHALL compute SMA(5) for trend identification
3. WHEN generating momentum indicators THEN the system SHALL compute MACD(12,26) with linear time complexity
4. WHEN computing indicators THEN the system SHALL ensure all calculations respect temporal ordering
5. IF insufficient historical data exists THEN the system SHALL skip indicator calculation and log the condition
6. WHEN indicators are computed THEN the system SHALL normalize values to prevent scale dominance in model training

### Requirement 3: Sentiment Analysis Integration

**User Story:** As a behavioral finance analyst, I want the system to quantify market sentiment from news sources, so that I can capture qualitative market factors that impact price movements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing news headlines THEN the system SHALL use VADER sentiment analyzer for scoring
2. WHEN analyzing sentiment THEN the system SHALL generate compound scores ranging from -1 to +1
3. WHEN aggregating sentiment THEN the system SHALL compute mean compound scores per ticker
4. WHEN sentiment processing occurs THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within 0.01 seconds per sentence
5. IF no recent news exists for a ticker THEN the system SHALL assign neutral sentiment score (0.0)
6. WHEN integrating sentiment THEN the system SHALL combine scores with technical features as model inputs

### Requirement 4: CPU-Optimized Model Training and Inference

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the model to operate efficiently on CPU-only hardware, so that I can deploy the system in cost-effective, low-latency environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN training the model THEN the system SHALL use XGBoost with CPU-specific optimizations
2. WHEN configuring XGBoost THEN the system SHALL set n_jobs=1 for single-threaded execution
3. WHEN building trees THEN the system SHALL use tree_method='exact' for CPU-optimized construction
4. WHEN performing inference THEN the system SHALL achieve sub-10ms latency on standard CPU hardware
5. WHEN limiting model complexity THEN the system SHALL constrain max_depth to 5-7 levels
6. WHEN validating performance THEN the system SHALL use TimeSeriesSplit for chronological train-test splits

### Requirement 5: Real-Time Pipeline Orchestration

**User Story:** As a trading system operator, I want the pipeline to run automatically and reliably, so that I have consistent, timely predictions without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scheduling execution THEN the system SHALL run daily at 5:30 PM IST via GitHub Actions
2. WHEN the pipeline executes THEN it SHALL process data ingestion, feature engineering, and model inference sequentially
3. WHEN generating predictions THEN the system SHALL output directional signals (buy/sell/hold)
4. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN it SHALL achieve target directional accuracy of 80%+ on validation data
5. IF any pipeline stage fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and attempt graceful recovery
6. WHEN storing results THEN the system SHALL maintain prediction history for performance tracking

### Requirement 6: Project Configuration and Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper project configuration and environment setup, so that the codebase is maintainable and deployment-ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the project THEN the system SHALL include a .gitignore file
2. WHEN configuring gitignore THEN the system SHALL exclude .kiro directory from version control
3. WHEN organizing project structure THEN the system SHALL include standard Python project files (requirements.txt, README.md)
4. WHEN setting up dependencies THEN the system SHALL specify exact versions for reproducible builds
5. IF environment variables are needed THEN the system SHALL provide example configuration files
6. WHEN documenting setup THEN the system SHALL include clear installation and usage instructions

### Requirement 7: Performance Monitoring and Validation

**User Story:** As a quantitative researcher, I want to monitor model performance and validate predictions, so that I can ensure the system maintains accuracy over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating model performance THEN the system SHALL track directional accuracy metrics
2. WHEN measuring latency THEN the system SHALL log inference times for performance monitoring
3. WHEN validating predictions THEN the system SHALL compare against actual market movements
4. WHEN detecting performance degradation THEN the system SHALL alert operators if accuracy drops below 75%
5. IF model drift is detected THEN the system SHALL support retraining with updated data
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL provide performance summaries including accuracy, precision, and recall metrics
